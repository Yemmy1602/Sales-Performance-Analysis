# Sales Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
---

This Sales Performance Dashboard offers a clear view of a retail store's sales metrics, highlighting revenue, total transactions, top-selling products, and
regional sales performance. The analysis was done using Excel and SQL, with Power BI used for interactive visualization. 
This dashboard helps stakeholders pinpoint high-revenue products and regions, track seasonal trends, and make informed decisions to optimize inventory and marketing.
